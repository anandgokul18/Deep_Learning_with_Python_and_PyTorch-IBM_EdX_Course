# IBM-Deep-Learning-with-Python-and-PyTorch

This repo holds my solutions (in Python) for the programming assignments of the edX's Deep Learning with Python and PyTorch Course by IBM

Course URL: https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-with-python-and-pytorch

##Contents:

###Module 1:

1) 1- 1D tensors.ipynb

Covers basics of Tensors (in 1-dimension), Data types, Indexing and Slicing, Basic Operations in Pytorch like addition, multiplication, dot product, broadcasting and plotting functions

2) 2- 2D Tensors.ipynb

Covers examples of 2-dimension tensors, Tensor creation in 2D, Iindexing and Slicing in 2D and basic operations on 2D tensors

3) 3- Derivatives.ipynb

Covers derivatives and how to find derivatives in Pytorch using .backward(), partial derivatives wrt different variables and a cool way to find derivatives wrt to entire function (&not being limited to Pytorch which takes derivatives of only scalar functions)

4) 4- Simple Dataset.ipynb

Covers how to build a simple dataset object. We will define a dataset class and override the Python's getitem() and len() methods in our class for the objects.

5) 5- using Transforms on MNIST dataset.ipynb

Covers using prebuilt datasets (MNIST) and also using some Transform operationson a dataset

### Module 2:

1) 1- Making a prediction.ipynb

2) 2- Linear Regression (only one parameter).ipynb

3) 3- Linear Regression- Training 2 Parameters.ipynb

4) 4- Stochastic_gradient_descent_with dataloader.ipynb

5) 5- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.ipynb

6) 6- PyTorch way.ipynb
